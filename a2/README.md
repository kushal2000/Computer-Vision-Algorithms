## Assignment 2

* Execute using ``` python a2.py Garden.JPG```

* Implements the required GUI for drawing line segments

* Initially two pairs of parallel lines are drawn through the GUI.

* The line through their vanishing points gives the vanishing line

* A line parallel to the vanishing line is drawn on the image passing through its centre

* A point P is taken input from which a vertical bar is constructed between the above two lines

* Output so far stored in transformed.jpg

* A plausible homography and affine transformation are also constructed for the image.
